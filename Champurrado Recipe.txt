Ingredients
▢8 cups of water
▢5 oz. of piloncillo or ½ cup of sugar
▢1 cinnamon stick
▢2 Mexican Chocolate tablets 6.5 ounces
▢¾ cup of masa harina corn flour
Instructions

Place 6 cups of water in a large saucepan along with the piloncillo and the cinnamon stick. Heat water until it starts boiling and then reduce the heat and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes until the piloncillo has melted. If you are using regular sugar, this step will take less time, since the sugar will dissolve in about 4-5 minutes.
Once the piloncillo or sugar has dissolved, add the 2 Mexican Chocolate Tablets and allow about 5 minutes to dissolve, stirring from time to time.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, pour the other 2 cups of water and mix in the masa harina. Mix well with an egg beater if possible to avoid forming any clumps. Make sure you have a very creamy texture.
When the chocolate has completely dissolved, slowly pour the masa harina mixture into the saucepan while stirring, to make sure there are no clumps. If you want to be safe and avoid masa harina clumps, use a strainer to pour the mixture.
Turn the heat to medium-high until the Champurrado starts boiling, and then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, stirring constantly. After 6-8 minutes the mixture will thicken. Allow to cook for 5 more minutes. Be careful while serving the champurrado, its thick consistency keeps the drink extremely hot!
